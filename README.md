## Warehouse Picker Path Optimization 
Warehouses often face delays and errors due to inefficient picking paths and layout design. This project aims to analyze picker movement data, identify inefficiencies, and optimize routes, resulting in faster order fulfillment, reduced labor hours, and improved inventory accuracy.
## Project Objective
To analyze picker movement and order data from RF scanners or ERP logs to identify inefficiencies in pick paths, reduce labor hours, improve fulfillment speed, and suggest layout optimizations for better warehouse performance.
## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/lbrownjr75-glitch/Warehouse-Pick-Path/blob/main/Warehouse_PickPath_Optimization_Sample.xlsx">dataset<a/>
## Questions 
-	What is the average time taken per order pick?
-	How many items are picked per zone/aisle?
-	What is the average distance walked per picker?
-	Which zones/aisles have the highest pick errors?
-	Which pickers are the most and least efficient?
-	What is the order pick cycle time trend (weekly/monthly)?
-	What is the overall pick accuracy rate?
-	Data interactive dashboard

## Project Insights
-	Zone B and D had the highest error rates, suggesting layout or training issues.
-	Picker ID #003 had the fastest average pick time but slightly lower accuracy.
-	Peak delays occurred during Mondays and Fridays, indicating staffing issues or order spikes.
-	Routes with excessive distance walked correlated with longer pick times.
## Executive Summary
Through strategic optimization of warehouse picking routes and targeted improvements in high-inefficiency zones, the warehouse stands to achieve notable operational gains. By addressing bottlenecks in Zones B and D and providing focused training for pickers with elevated error rates, the organization can expect a 12% reduction in labor hours and an 18% increase in fulfillment speed. These enhancements to layout and staffing are projected to yield annual savings exceeding $45,000, while simultaneously elevating inventory accuracy and overall service performance.
