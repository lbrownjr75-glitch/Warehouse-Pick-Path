# Warehouse Picker Path Optimization 
Warehouses often face delays and errors due to inefficient picking paths and layout design. This project aims to analyze picker movement data, identify inefficiencies, and optimize routes, resulting in faster order fulfillment, reduced labor hours, and improved inventory accuracy.
## Project Objective
To analyze picker movement and order data from RF scanners or ERP logs to identify inefficiencies in pick paths, reduce labor hours, improve fulfillment speed, and suggest layout optimizations for better warehouse performance.
